# Personal Website :fire:

Hi! Thanks for checking out the repo for my personal website. You can visit it by clicking [here](http://danielmtan.com/).

## Getting Started

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# generate static project for production
$ npm run generate
```

For this project, I used Nuxt, a progressive framework based on Vue.js.  For more information and detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

Hosted on AWS using S3 (Simple Storage Service) and CloudFront (CDN). And Jenkins for automated deployments!

Mahalo for checking it out! :v:
